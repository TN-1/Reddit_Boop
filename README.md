# Reddit_Boop
A reddit bot written in python to kick inactive members and add new members to a subreddit automatically

To run this bot, run `pip install -r requirments.txt` to install dependencies then run as you would any other python program.
Youll need to edit some sections of code so the bot will work, the comments in the code detail this.
