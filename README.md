# Reddit_Boop
A reddit bot written in python to kick inactive members and add new members to a subreddit automatically

To run this bot, run `pip install -r requirments.txt` to install dependencies then run as you would any other python program.
Youll need to edit some sections of code so the bot will work, the comments in the code detail this.  
  
This project has now been superseded. This code is broken with recent reddit API changes and I have moved on to a much more functional sucessor. This code is now just here for sentimental reasons.
